# Ramblings - Repository
This is my 1st GitHub repository.

There's not much to see here, this is basically a "Hello World" repository.

This is a change made on the "readme-edits" branch, as it is was supposed to be.

* *Note to self #1*: NEVER commit on the "master" branch, always use a feature branch instead and then merge it.

* Another oddity of Git is that feature branches are not useful anymore after they are merged using "pull-requests", they can be safely deleted, and the website prompts to do that (at some point).

* Useful links:

Task list:
- [x] Should delete unused/merged feature branches
- [ ] Perform the same operations from the CLI/GitBash prompt (pending)
Have you tried turning-it-ON-and-OFF? Maybe a Windows restart will fix the issue.
- [ ] Check out linking issues to pull-requests: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue

All the best,
