# Ramblings - Repository
This is my 1st GitHub repository.

There's not much to see here, this is basically a "Hello World" repository.

This is a change made on the "readme-edits" branch, as it is was supposed to be.

* Note to self #1: NEVER commit on the "master" branch, always use a feature branch instead and then merge it.

* Another oddity of Git is that feature branches are not useful anymore after they are merged using "pull-requests", they can be safely deleted, and the website prompts to do that (at some point).

Task list:
- Should delete unused/merged feature branches
- Perform the same operations from the CLI/GitBash prompt

All the best,
Captain Geek
