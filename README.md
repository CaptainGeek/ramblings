# Ramblings - Repository
This is my 1st GitHub repository.

There's not much to see here, this is basically a "Hello World" repository.

This is a change made on the "readme-edits" branch, as it is was supposed to be.

## Note to self #1: NEVER commit on the "master" branch, always use a feature branch instead and then merge it.
